      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        Mario gets a letter witch says: Dear Mario, please come to the castle.
        I've <br />
        baked a cake for you. Yours truly, Princess Peach.
        <br />
        How exiting! Mario runs of to the castle, but when he enters is a gruff
        <br />
        voice says: No one's home! Now scram! Bwa, ha, ha. In this <br />
        game mario looks for power stars and uses them to enter locked doors.
      </p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike other mario games this one is 3d. Mario can defeat enemies not
        just <br />
        by jumping on them, but also by kicking and punching them. You get power
        <br />
        stars by finding them in various levels and by beating bosses.
