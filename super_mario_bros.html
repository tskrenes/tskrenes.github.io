      <h2>hard mode</h2>
      <p>
        After you beat the game you can choose to select a world (by pressing
        B<br />
        on the title screen) to play in "a new quest" a mode where all the<br />
        goombas are replaced by buzzy beetles and all the lifts are about 60%<br />
        smaller then they used to be.
      </p>

      <h2>glitches</h2>
      <h5>minus world</h5>
      <p>
        The Minus World is an endless underwater level, identical to World 7-2,
        which is accessed through a glitch. There is no way to complete the
        level, as entering the pipe <br />at the end will simply return Mario or
        Luigi to the one at the beginning. To perform the glitch, Mario must go
        to World 1-2 and stand on top of the pipe that leads to the flag,
        <br />without going in the pipe. Then he must break the second and third
        block from the pipe, but leave the one on the far right. Then he must
        stand on the left edge of <br />the pipe (facing left) and duck. He then
        has to jump while in a ducking position and move right in mid-air (while
        still facing left). If done correctly, Mario will go through the
        <br />block on the far right and the wall to the Warp Zone. Mario must
        then go through the pipe that would normally lead to World 2-1 or World
        4-1, and Mario will enter the Minus World.<br />
        If World 2-2 or 7-2 is edited in a ROM editor so that it is possible to
        beat it during the underwater segment, there is a World -2, an
        underwater version of 3-4. If World 3-4 is <br />edited in a ROM editor,
        then there is a World -3. It is also a version of 3-4, but with
        overworld graphics; beating World -3 takes the player to World -4, a
        level which is just a blank screen.
      </p>
      <h5>over the flagpole</h5>
      <p>
        Over the flagpole is a glitch first introduced in super mario bros. If
        you jump over the flagpole their is just an endless path. <br />to do
        this in level 3-3 jump onto the lift at the end and wait until the other
        side rises. Don't let it get to high or you cant jump onto it.<br />
        After that jump onto the other side and without it moving jump over the
        finish.
      </p>

      <h2>warps</h2>
      <h5>1-2</h5>
      <p>
        The warp in level 1-2 is hidden at the end of the level. Jump onto the
        last red platform at the end <br />
        of the level wait until it reaches the top. Now jump onto the bricks
        above the pipe that takes you <br />
        to the finish. Keep running until you reach a set of pipes. you can now
        select world 2, 3, or 4.
      </p>
      <h5>4-2 - world 6, 7, 8</h5>
      <p>
        The last warp is hidden in level 4-2. After you jump of the first red
        platform, there will be 3 blocks <br />
        above you. The one closest to the red lift has a vine in it. There are
        also 5 invisible blocks hit them <br />
        in the right order to reach to block containing the vine. Hit the block
        with the vine and climb it. <br />
        Once you jump across the mushroom platforms at the top, there will be 3
        pipes. Select world 6, 7, or 8.
      </p>
      <h5>4-2 - world 5</h5>
      <p>
        To warp to world 5, stand on the first red platform and stay on the top
        of the level. <br />
        Once at the end of the level you will find a room with a pipe. enter the
        pipe to go to world 5.
