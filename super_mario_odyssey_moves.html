    <h1>Super Mario Odyssey Speedrun Guide</h1>

    <p>
      This is a guide on how to speedrun mario odyssey. <br />
      <br />
      Tips: before speedruning, make sure you set the language to japanese(3rd
      from the bottom). The reason is because japanese has the least words.
      <br />
      In the moon kingdom, you can skip the moon caves(which saves a LOT of
      time!). To do it, at the quiet wall checkpoint head to the right where the
      sphinx can be found. <br />
      Get on its head and ground pound jump off of it. Next, perform a
      <a href="#capThrowHold">cap throw and hold</a> and run into
      cappy(remember, do this in the air) to bounce off of him, <br />
      then wall jump off of an L shape on the wall, then bounce off of the other
      wall and dive onto the ledge in front of you. <br />
      Another tip is to play in 2 player mode. If the moon cave skip is too
      hard, in 2 player mode, the moon caves only take about 10 minutes(which is
      10 minutes added to your speedrun time).
      <br />
      In the lake kingdom, you will find some broken stairs. Triple jump and
      then cap dive to get on top of them(skipping the spiky waterway). <br />
      Make sure you skip any cutscenes (by pressing +). Some of them are quite
      long.<br />When doing the darker side speedrun, you can skip the whole
      underground part with a simple glitch. <br />
      To do it, you must capture a frog, jump, un-capture the frog, bounce on
      another frog's head and capture it at the same time. You can then swim
      through the air. The glitch ends when you un-capture the frog, or jump.
    </p>

    <h2>Speedrun Rules</h2>
    <p>
      Speedrun starts whey you start a new file and ends when you zoom away on
      the spark pylon at the end. Beat the game as fast as you can and add any
      challenges you want to (although these count a different speedrun). For
      challenges see <a href="#challenges">this</a>. For types of speedruns see
      <a href="#speedruns">this</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Moves</h2>
    <br />

    <h3>Player One Controls</h3>
    <br />

    <h4>Run</h4>
    <p>
      The move you need most is running. As you can guess, you run by pushing
      the control stick in any direction.
    </p>

    <h4>Walk</h4>
    <p>
      You can walk in the same way you run, except you push the control stick
      more lightly.
    </p>

    <h4>Jump</h4>
    <p>You can't beat the game without jumping! To jump just press A or B.</p>

    <h4>Cap Throw</h4>
    <p>
      You can can do a cap throw by pressing X or Y. If this is done in midair,
      it will slow Mario's fall a little bit. You can also cap throw by doing
      with the joycons what you would when actually throwing a cap.
    </p>

    <h4>Capture</h4>
    <p>
      To capture, you must perform a cap throw near an enemy without a hat. If
      one does have a hat, you can knock it off the same way you
      capture(remember, captures only work on some enemies).
    </p>

    <h4>Spin</h4>
    <p>
      To spin, rotate the control stick around. Mario will start spin around.
      Spins can slow mario's falling time a little bit.
    </p>

    <h4>Downwards Throw</h4>
    <p>
      If you downwards throw, cappy will zoom downward. To downward throw ether
      whip the joycons downward, or ground pound and then throw cappy.
    </p>

    <h4>Upwards Throw</h4>
    <p>
      Upward throws are the opposite of downward throws. This time, to perform
      an upwards throw you can only whip the joycons up.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ground_pound">Ground Pound</h4>
    <p>
      To ground pound, press ZL in midair. Ground pounds can find things hidden
      in the ground as well as quicken your falling speed. Ground pounds can
      also pound things into the ground.
    </p>

    <h4>Ground Pound Jump</h4>
    <p>
      Ground pound jumps can get higher than jumps. To ground pound jump, ground
      pound, then jump as soon as you hit the ground.
    </p>

    <h4>Spin Jump</h4>
    <p>Spin jumps are what they sound like. To spin jump, spin, then jump.</p>

    <h4>Spin Throw</h4>
    <p>
      If your surrounded by enemies and wish you could just kill them all at
      once, spin throws are for you. To spin throw, ether spin and do a cap
      throw or whip the joycons around you.
    </p>

    <h4>Homing Cap Throw</h4>
    <p>
      If your aim is a little off, a homing cap throw will do the trick. To do a
      homing cap throw, perform a cap throw and shake the joycons.
    </p>

    <h4>Crouch</h4>
    <p>
      With crouching, you can access areas you otherwise couldn't. To crouch,
      press ZL.
    </p>

    <h4>Roll</h4>
    <p>
      Rolling is a little bit faster then running. To roll, you must crouch and
      then continue pressing Y(X also works).
    </p>

    <h4>Ledge Climb</h4>
    <p>
      By ledge climbing, you can hold onto a ledge. To ledge climb, approach a
      ledge at a slow speed. Mario will grab onto the ledge.
    </p>

    <h4>Pole Climb</h4>
    <p>
      With pole climbing, you can climb poles. To pole climb, jump onto a pole.
      Press B(or A) at any time when climbing the pole to jump off. At the top
      of the pole, press A or B to flip off.
    </p>

    <h4 id="capThrowHold">Cap Throw And Hold</h4>
    <p>
      These are just a different kind of cap throw. To perform one, press and
      hold X (or Y).
    </p>

    <h4>Wall Jump</h4>
    <p>
      To wall jump, jump at a wall and press B or A as soon as Mario touches the
      wall. If there are 2 walls next to each other(and they are close enough),
      repeat this to get very high.
    </p>

    <h4>Cap Jump</h4>
    <p>
      Cap jumping can get you to higher places than jumps can. To cap jump press
      and hold Y(or X), then run into the cap. It will give you a large boost.
    </p>

    <h4>Crouch Walk</h4>
    <p>
      To crouch walk, hold ZL and then move the control stick in any direction.
      It is slower than walking, but you can walk into small places.
    </p>

    <h4>Dive</h4>
    <p>
      While in midair, press ZL and Y or X. It gives you a little boost forward
      in the air but keep in mind that you can not do anything once you dive.
    </p>

    <h4>Cap Dive</h4>
    <p>
      Cap dives can get much higher than jumps. To cap dive, jump, cap throw,
      and then dive onto the cap.
    </p>

    <h4>Long Jump</h4>
    <p>
      With long jumps, you can not get as high as jumps but you can get farther
      than jumps. To long jump, press ZL and B(or A) while running.
    </p>

    <h4>Double Jump</h4>
    <p>
      To double jump, jump and then as soon as you hit the ground jump again.
    </p>

    <h4>Triple Jump</h4>
    <p>
      To triple jump, double jump and the jump again as soon as you hit the
      ground. You must be moving at least mario's walking speed to triple jump.
      Triple jumps are the highest kind of jump.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Player Two Controls</h3>
    <br />

    <h4>Move</h4>
    <p>
      When playing as cappy, moving is a little different. First press X or Y,
      then you can move the control stick in any direction you want. Press X(or
      Y) to return to mario. The following moves have to be done while flying.
    </p>

    <h4>Jump</h4>
    <p>
      The controls for jumping as cappy are the same as jumping as mario: just
      press A. If you're on mario's head and press A or B, you can cap bounce
      mario (which does <em>not</em> count as jumping but is the same hight as a
      jump).
    </p>

    <h4>Ground Pound</h4>
    <p>
      Ground pounding can be done by jumping and then pressing ZL. They do the
      same things as <a href="#ground_pound">mario's ground pounds.</a>
    </p>

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Power Moons</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Cascade Kingdom</h3>
    <br />
    <h4>Our First Power Moon</h4>
    <p>
      You don't need any power moons in the cap kingdom, so the next kingdom is
      the cascade kingdom. To find this moon, you must capture the chain chomp
      and smash the glowing rocks behind it.
    </p>

    <h4>Behind The Waterfall</h4>
    <p>
      After breaking the wall containing the 8-bit section, head up to the top
      and hit the hidden block next to the waterfall. Then jump onto it and grab
      the moon behind the falls.
    </p>

    <h4>Multi Moon Atop The Falls</h4>
    <p>
      The missions objective is to defeat madame broode on top of the waterfall.
      To beat her, you must knock off the cap on her "adorable chain chompikins"
      then capture it. She will then try to smack you. If she does, you will
      un-capture the chain chomp. After a little while she will get tired of
      trying to smack you, then pull back on the control stick and let go. After
      beating her, you get a multi moon which is 3 power moons.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Sand Kingdom</h3>
    <br />
    <h4>Employees Only</h4>
    <p>
      This power moon is found inside the crazy cap shop. To get it, you must go
      to the back of the building where you will find a small hole in which you
      must crouch walk into. You will find yourself in the back of the crazy cap
      store where a power moon can be found.
    </p>

    <h4>A Rumble From The Sandy Floor</h4>
    <p>
      Outside the crazy cap shop, you can find an umbrella which you must bounce
      on to get onto the roof. There will be a pipe which will take you to an
      area where you have to ground pound on the place where the joycons rumble
      most(which is in the top left corner). The prize is a power moon.
    </p>

    <h4>Overlooking The Desert Town</h4>
    <p>
      This power moon is found on top of the large building in the left half of
      the town.
    </p>

    <h4>Inside The Block Is A Hard Place</h4>
    <p>
      This power moon is found a little south of the tostarena ruins sand
      pillar. It is in a glowing block which you must break with a bullet bill.
    </p>

    <h4>On The Leaning Pillar</h4>
    <p>
      You must capture a bullet bill and use it to collect the power moon on one
      of the leaning pillars.
    </p>

    <h4>Alcove In The Ruins</h4>
    <p>
      Like the name says, it is found in an alcove in the ruins west of the
      tostarena ruins sand pillar checkpoint.
    </p>

    <h4>From A Crate In The Ruins</h4>
    <p>
      Next to the bullet bill cannon south of the tostarena ruins round tower,
      you can find a glowing crate which you must ground pound on to receive a
      power moon which will land on top of a ledge south of the crate.
    </p>

    <h4>Atop The Highest Tower</h4>
    <p>
      To get this power moon, you must traverse the ruins a little bit past the
      town. The moon is found after the 8-bit section.
    </p>

    <h4>Moon Shards In The Sand</h4>
    <p>
      To get this moon, you have to collect all of the moon shards in the
      moe-eye habitat which are found on an invisible platform above the poison,
      on top of one of the towers in the poison, between 2 cacti, on a hill, and
      next to a moe-eye.
    </p>

    <h4>Lost In The Luggage</h4>
    <p>
      Before entering the inverted pyramid, there will be a glowing spot
      surrounded by boxes and tyres. If you ground pound on it, a power moon
      will appear.
    </p>

    <h4>Showdown On The Inverted Pyramid</h4>
    <p>
      The object of this mission is to fight hariet on top of the inverted
      pyramid by knocking back the bombs she throws(by throwing cappy at it) and
      then jumping on her head. By doing this, you get a multi moon.
    </p>

    <h4>The Hole In The Desert</h4>
    <p>
      You must defeat knucklotec in a hole underneath the inverted pyramid after
      it rises up. To defeat him, you must lure one of his hands onto a patch of
      ice and capture it when he is stunned, and then punch him in the face.
      After doing this, you get a multi moon.
    </p>

    <h3>Lake Kingdom</h3>
    <br />

    <h4>On The Lake Shore</h4>
    <p>
      When you first land in the lake kingdom, you will find a glowing spot next
      to the odyssey. You will receive a power moon if you ground pound on it.
    </p>

    <h4>Cheep Cheep Crossing</h4>
    <p>
      This power moon can be found under the underwater entrance checkpoint.
    </p>

    <h4>Dorrie-Back Rider</h4>
    <p>This power moon can be found on dorrie's back.</p>

    <h4>Broodals Over The Lake</h4>
    <p>
      This missions objective is to defeat rango on top of a large stone
      structure on top of the lake. To beat him, throw you cap at his and bounce
      off of the flower on his hat(now exposed), then jump on his head.
    </p>

    <h4>Whats In The Box?</h4>
    <p>
      On top of the water plaza, there will be a platform with a glowing crate
      on it. If you pound on it, you will receive a power moon.
    </p>

    <h4>End Of A Hidden Passage</h4>
    <p>
      I know this moon sounds hard, but it is actually pretty easy. At the
      start, you can find a platform with a hat flower on it. Bounce off of it
      and onto another platform containing a zipper which you can capture. After
      un-zipping it, a hidden passage will be revealed with a power moon at the
      end.
    </p>

    <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Blindfold Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      You must have played the game once to speedrun it <em>blindfolded</em>! To
      do this challenge, you must speedrun the game first, and then play it
      blindfolded. Combine the two and you get this challenge.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>No Jumping Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      You may think that it is impossible to not jump, but cap jumping does not
      count as jumping(also, jumping in captures does not count as jumping
      ether) so this challenge isn't to hard is it? Well... your jumps are a
      little delayed but other than that nothings different.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>No Cap Throw Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Out of all of the challenges, this one is one of the hardest. Even harder
      than the blindfold challenge. Wait, if you can't cap throw you can't
      capture right? Well no. After cap bouncing in 2 player mode or cap jumping
      in 1 player mode, cappy stays there for a little bit. So if you get the
      distance just right, you can still capture.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>No Coins Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      This challenge is one of the easiest. Its a little bit hard because coins
      sometimes come out of places you wouldn't even think of and you're bound
      to collect at least <em>one</em> coin on your way to the boss.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>No Jumping, No Cap Throw, No Coins Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      This challenge is almost impossible. You will need to create a copy of
      your file(when you haven't jumped, thrown cappy, or collected any coins)
      because you probably do one of these things on the way to the boss.
    </p>
    <br /><br />

    <h2 id="speedruns">Types Of Speedruns</h2>

    <br />
    <h3>Any%</h3>
    <p>
      The most common speedrun. In this speedrun, it doesn't mater how many
      bosses you beat, how many moons you collect or anything like that. All you
      have to do is complete the main game.
    </p>

    <h3>All Moons</h3>
    <p>
      In this speedrun, you have to collect all the moons in the game as fast as
      you can.
    </p>

    <h3>100%</h3>
    <p>
      This speedrun is the hardest one to do. The fastest speedrun is 8 hours,
      48 minutes, and 45 seconds. You must collect all of the moons and regional
      coins.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenge Speedrun</h3>
    <p>
      Add any challenge to your speedrun (challenges shown above) and beat the
      game as fast as you can.
    </p>

    <h3>Dark Side</h3>
    <p>
      Get to and beat the dark side. You must collect 250 power moons before you
      can get to the dark side.
    </p>

    <h3>Darker Side</h3>
    <p>
      The darker side requires 500 power moons to reach it. Once there, you must
      collect the multi moon at the end.
    </p>

    <h3>World Peace</h3>
    <p>You must complete all of the story missions and then beat bowser.</p>

    <h3>Challenge Speedrun 2</h3>
    <p>
      This is sort of a weird speedrun. In this, you must complete a certain
      amount of challenges (like collecting 3 painting moons, 5 moons buried in
      the ground, etc).
    </p>

    <h3>Talkatoo%</h3>
    <p>
      In this speedrun, you can only get moons that Talkatoo says. Remember, he
      only gives the names of 3 moons at a time.
    </p>
    <br /><br />

    <h2>Mods</h2>

    <p>
      Mods modify the game and usually create extra challenges. This section
      will show you most of the mods. For a full list of mods, check out
      <a
        href="https://gamebanana.com/search?_nPage=1&_sOrder=best_match&_sSearchString=super+mario+odyssey+mods"
        >this page</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Levels Mod</h3>
    <p>
      The custom levels mod has custom levels people created (like Bianco Hills,
      Bob-omb Battlefield etc).
    </p>

    <h3>The Floor Is Lava Mod</h3>
    <p>
      This mod is very hard. The whole floor is lava. Things sticking out of the
      lava do not have lava on top of them. Also, there are some platforms that
      are added to make the game beatable.
    </p>

    <h3>Superstar Mode Mod</h3>
    <p>
      If you find the game too easy and want a little challenge, try superstar
      mode. This makes the game a "little bit" harder. For example, the first
      madame broode boss is the same as the regular moon kingdom. And the sand
      kingdom's floor is lava!
    </p>

    <h3>Underwater Mod</h3>
    <p>
      In this mod, the whole game is underwater. No matter how high you swim,
      you can never reach the top. But power moons refill your health and air.
    </p>

    <h3>Gravity Mod</h3>
    <p>
      This (for me) is the most fun mod. In this mod, the gravity switches every
      30 seconds. For whatever reason, the game's north, west, south, and east
      are different than on the compass. Gravity does not switch in captures.
    </p>

    <h3>Bad Cappy Mod</h3>
    <p>
      So in this mod, you can not walk or run with cappy on your head (you can
      in captures). But whats the "bad" part? Well, after you throw cappy, you
      can move but when cappy reaches mario, mario dies! Cappy now can get stuck
      behind things and moves slower. Also, cappy's distance behind mario is
      shown (in metres).
